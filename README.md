# ENSE 281 – Team F: UR Lost & Found

## Project Overview

**UR Lost & Found** is a centralized digital system designed to modernize how lost items are reported, tracked, and returned at the University of Regina. The platform provides Protective Services staff with an organized and efficient tool to log, manage, and search for found items, while allowing students and staff to submit and monitor lost item reports online.

The system aims to improve service efficiency, reduce in-person inquiries, and enhance transparency in the lost and found process across campus.

## Project Purpose (The “Why”)

Currently, lost and found operations rely heavily on in-person visits, phone calls, and manual tracking methods. This leads to inefficiencies, delays, and frustration for both Protective Services staff and campus users.

Our team is creating UR Lost & Found to:

- Streamline the reporting and tracking of lost items  
- Reduce administrative workload on Protective Services  
- Improve accessibility and service experience for students and staff  

---

## Intended Impact

When we are done, **a manual and fragmented lost-and-found process** will become **a centralized, efficient, and accessible digital service**.

To achieve this, we will design and prototype a web-based system that:

- Allows users to submit lost item reports online  
- Enables staff to log, update, and manage found items in one place  
- Improves response time and communication between staff and users  

---

## Target Users (Who We Are Designing For)

### Primary Users
- University of Regina Protective Services staff (system administrators and item managers)

### Secondary Users
- Students and staff who report or claim lost items

These users currently rely on physical visits, phone calls, or email inquiries. Our system aims to provide a more efficient and convenient alternative.
